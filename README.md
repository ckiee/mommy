```
$ nix-shell -p mommy
[nix-shell:~]$ mommy
who's my good girl~
```

* or you can let mommy live in your NixOS or home-manager system by adding mommy to your nix expression:
<table>
    <tr>
      <th>NixOS (default: <code>/etc/nixos/configuration.nix</code>)</th>
      <th>home-manager</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><pre lang="nix">environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
  mommy
];</pre></td>
      <td><pre lang="nix">home.packages = with pkgs; [
  mommy
];</pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>

 * mommy can be configured like this using home-manager or the nix CLIs too~
   ``` nix
   environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
     (mommy.override {
       mommySettings = {
         sweetie = "catgirl";
         # all of mommy's other settings work here too!
         # please scroll down to find out what they are~
       };
     })
   ];
   ```
   
</details>

<details>
<summary>windows</summary>

* **wsl** (automatic or manual updates)  
  follow any of the mommy installation instructions for your installed linux subsystem (default is ubuntu) or
  [build mommy from source](#-without-a-package-manager)~
* **msys2** (automatic or manual updates)  
  follow any of the mommy installation instructions for _arch linux_ (except **do not use the arch user repository
  method**) or [build mommy from source](#-without-a-package-manager)~
* **cygwin** (manual updates)  
  there is no mommy package for cygwin.
  instead, you can [build mommy from source](#-without-a-package-manager)
  (aka: run a script that copies a few files for you)~
</details>

### üêê without a package manager
<details>
<summary>build from source and install</summary>

if you want to customise where and how mommy installs, you can just compile her code yourself~

1. **prerequisites**
    * [git](https://git-scm.com/)
    * [gnu make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
2. **clone repository**
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/FWDekker/mommy.git
   cd mommy
   ```
3. **install**  
   this step builds mommy's files and copies them into your system.
   the exact paths differ per system, so find the instructions that are right for your system.

   > ‚ÑπÔ∏è if you want to install mommy only for the current user, add `prefix='~/.local/'` before `install`~

   > ‚ÑπÔ∏è check the [makefile](https://github.com/FWDekker/mommy/blob/main/GNUmakefile) for a list of all prefix variables
   > you can override~
   
    * _debian/ubuntu/apt-based_
      ```shell
      sudo make zsh_prefix='$(prefix)/share/zsh/vendor-completions/' install
      ```
    * _all other linux / windows_
      ```shell
      sudo make install
      ```
    * _macos/freebsd_
      ```shell
      sudo gmake prefix='/usr/local/' install
      ```
    * _netbsd_
      ```shell
      sudo gmake prefix='/usr/pkg/' man_prefix='$(prefix)/man/'
      ```
    * _openbsd_
      ```shell
      sudo gmake prefix='/usr/local/' man_prefix='$(prefix)/man/'
      ```
4. **test** (optional)  
   if you want to make sure installation was successful, you can run tests using
   [shellspec](https://github.com/shellspec/shellspec).
   run the following from inside the cloned mommy repository
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/shellspec/shellspec.git
   PATH="$(pwd)/shellspec/:$PATH" make test
   ```
   some tests will be skipped, depending on which other programs you have installed~
5. **uninstall** (optional)  
   if you want to uninstall after running `make install`, just run the same command as in step 3, except you replace
   `install` with `uninstall`.
   so on debian, you'd run `sudo make zsh_prefix='$(prefix)/share/zsh/vendor-completions/' uninstall`~

   uninstall might not work completely if you installed a different version than the one you're uninstalling.
   for the best results, run `mommy -v`, check the version number, run `git checkout <the version>`, and then perform
   the uninstallation~
</details>

<details>
<summary>use without installing</summary>

if you don't want to use a package manager but also don't want to bother with `make`ing mommy, you can download a
universal build of mommy, and play around with that.
this will not install any files into your system.
if you're here because you want to install mommy only for a specific user, the "build from source and install" option
is probably a better approach, though~

the script below downloads the latest stable release and extracts it for you.
if you don't want to use curl, just [check the latest release](https://github.com/FWDekker/mommy/releases/latest) in
your browser and download the `+generic.tar.gz` file manually~

```shell
# download latest archive from github release
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/FWDekker/mommy/releases/latest | grep "browser_download_url.*generic\.tar\.gz" | cut -d : -f 2,3 | tr -d \" | xargs curl -sLOJ
# extract archive to `mommy`
tar -C ./ -xzf mommy-*.tar.gz
# invoke mommy
./mommy/usr/bin/mommy
```
</details>

### üîÆ what's next?
check out [how to use mommy](#-usage), read all about [ways you can configure mommy](#-configuration), and
[integrate mommy with your shell](#-shell-integration)~

<img width="450px" src=".github/img/sample1.png" alt="mommy integrated with the fish shell" />


## üìñ usage
mommy integrates with your normal command-line usage and compliments you if the command succeeds and encourages you if
it fails~

```shell
$ mommy [-1] [-c config] [command] ...
# e.g. `mommy npm test`

$ mommy [-1] [-c config] -e eval
# e.g. `mommy -e "ls -l | wc -l"`

$ mommy [-1] [-c config] -s status
# e.g. `mommy -s $?`
```

by default, mommy outputs to stderr, but if you use `mommy -1 [other options]` she'll output to stdout~

use `mommy -v` to see which version of mommy you're using~


## üôã configuration
mommy's behavior can be configured by defining variables in `~/.config/mommy/config.sh`.
or specify a different config file with `mommy -c ./my_config.sh [other options]`~

### üóÉÔ∏è config file format
mommy executes the config file as a shell script and keeps the environment variables.
so, to change the value of `MOMMY_SWEETIE`, add the following line to your config file:
```shell
MOMMY_SWEETIE="catgirl"
```
make sure you do not put spaces around the `=`~

### ü™£ lists
some of these settings support lists.
mommy chooses a random element from each list each time she is called by you.
(except for `MOMMY_FORBIDDEN_WORDS` and `MOMMY_SUPPRESS_EXIT`, where all elements of the list are always considered.)
in a list, elements are separated by a newline or by a `/`.
elements that contain whitespace only, and elements that start with a `#` are ignored~

* for example, if you set
  ```shell
  MOMMY_SWEETIE="girl/kitten"
  ```
  then mommy will sometimes call you `girl`, and sometimes `kitten`~
* if you set
  ```shell
  MOMMY_CAREGIVER="mommy
  mummy/#daddy/caregiver"
  ```
  then mommy will call herself `mommy`, `mummy`, or `caregiver`, but not `daddy`~
* if you set
  ```shell
  MOMMY_PRONOUNS="she her her/they them their"
  ```
  then mommy may choose between `mommy knows she loves her girl` and `mommy knows they love their girl`~
* if you set
  ```shell
  MOMMY_FORBIDDEN_WORDS="cat/dog"
  ```
  then mommy will never use templates that contain `cat`, and will never use templates that contain `dog`~

### üß¨ custom templates
you can add your own compliments to either `MOMMY_COMPLIMENTS` or `MOMMY_COMPLIMENTS_EXTRA`, but there is a slight
difference:
* if you want both the default _and_ your own compliments, add your own compliments to `MOMMY_COMPLIMENTS_EXTRA`, but
* if you want your own compliments and _not_ the default compliments, add your own compliments to `MOMMY_COMPLIMENTS`~

and similarly so for encouragements~

### üìõ template variables
inside compliments and encouragements, you can put placeholders that contain the random values that mommy chose.
for example, if you add the compliment `%%CAREGIVER%% loves you`, and have `MOMMY_CAREGIVER=your mommy`, then mommy
outputs `your mommy loves you`~

| variable        | description                                       |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `%%CAREGIVER%%` | what mommy calls herself                          |
| `%%THEY%%`      | mommy's subject pronoun (e.g. he, she, they)      |
| `%%THEM%%`      | mommy's object pronoun (e.g. him, her, them)      |
| `%%THEIR%%`     | mommy's possessive pronoun (e.g. his, her, their) |
| `%%SWEETIE%%`   | what mommy calls you                              |

### ‚úçÔ∏è renaming the mommy executable
if you want to write `daddy npm test` instead of `mommy npm test`, you can just create a symlink.
mommy is installed in slightly different locations on different systems, but you can easily find where mommy is
installed with `whereis mommy`:
```shell
$ whereis mommy
mommy: /usr/bin/mommy /usr/share/man/man1/mommy.1.gz
```
the exact format may differ depending on your system, but in this case you can see that the program is installed in
`/usr/bin/mommy` and the manual page in `/usr/share/man/man1/mommy.1.gz`.
if `whereis mommy` doesn't work, mommy is not on your path, but you can still find her with `find / -name mommy`~

anyway, after finding mommy, you can just symlink using the following commands:
(if `whereis` gave different paths than seen above, you should adapt these commands accordingly)
```shell
sudo ln -fs /usr/bin/mommy /usr/bin/daddy
sudo ln -fs /usr/share/man/man1/mommy.1.gz /usr/share/man/man1/daddy.1.gz
```


## üêö shell integration
instead of calling mommy for each command, you can also fully integrate mommy with your shell to get mommy's output each
time you run any command.
here are some examples on how you can do that in various shells.
recall that you can add `MOMMY_COMPLIMENTS_ENABLED=0` to your mommy config file to disable compliments while keeping
encouragements~

_this is just a small list of possibilities.
if you know of another way to integrate mommy, feel free to contribute them by opening a pull request!_

<details>
<summary>ü™Ö bash</summary>

in bash you can set
[`PROMPT_COMMAND`](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html#index-PROMPT_005fCOMMAND) to run
mommy after each command.
just add the following line to `~/.bashrc`:
```shell
PROMPT_COMMAND="mommy -1 -s \$?; $PROMPT_COMMAND"
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>üêü fish</summary>

in fish you can have mommy output a message on the right side of your prompt by creating
`~/.config/fish/functions/fish_right_prompt.fish` with the following contents:
```shell
function fish_right_prompt
    mommy -1 -s $status
end
```
if you have an [oh my fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish) theme installed, check the docs of your theme to
see if there's an easy way to extend the theme's right prompt.
if not, you can either overwrite it with the above code, or copy-paste the theme's code into your own config file and
then add mommy yourself~
</details>

<details>
<summary>üí§ zsh</summary>

in zsh you can put mommy's output after each command by adding the following line to `~/.zshrc`:
```shell
precmd() { mommy -1 -s $? }
```

to put mommy's output on the right side, add the following to `~/.zshrc`:
```shell
set -o PROMPT_SUBST
RPS1='$(mommy -1 -s $?)'
```
unfortunately, the `RPS1` solution does not work well with `MOMMY_COLOR`.
instead, you'll have to use a special zsh syntax for
[xterm color codes](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Xterm_256color_chart.svg) by adding the
following to your config:
```shell
MOMMY_COLOR=""
MOMMY_PREFIX="%F{005}/%F{006}"
MOMMY_SUFFIX="~%f"
```
this code randomly changes the output between magenta and cyan.
note the `%f` in the suffix, which resets the color~

</details>

<details>
<summary>üêå other shells</summary>

as a generic method, in any posix shell (including `sh`, `ash`, `dash`, `bash`) you can change the prompt itself to
contain a message from mommy by setting the `$PS1` variable:
```shell
PS1="\$(mommy -1 -s \$?)$PS1"
```
to improve the spacing, set `MOMMY_SUFFIX="~ "` in mommy's config file.

add the above line to the config file for your shell (e.g. `.bashrc` for `bash`) to apply it each time you open the
shell.
some shells (`dash`, `pdksh`) do not have a config file like `.bashrc`, but you can enable one by adding the following
line to `~/.profile`:
```shell
export ENV="$HOME/.shrc"
```
note that this will apply to all (non-login) posix shells that you open.
after that, add the above-mentioned line that defines `PS1` to `~/.shrc`.
log out and back in, and mommy will appear in your shell~

## ‚öóÔ∏è development
this section explains how to build mommy from source, in case you want to help with development or for any other reason~

### üé¨ run
you can actually just directly run the script in `src/main/sh/mommy`.
the only difference will be that the `-h` and `-v` options may not work correctly.
if that annoys you, run `make build` after each change, and use `build/bin/mommy` instead~

### üß™ tests
1. **requirements**  
   [shellspec](https://github.com/shellspec/shellspec)
2. **test local code**
   1. all tests
      ```shell
      make test
      ```
   2. unit tests
      ```shell
      make test/unit
      ```
   3. integration tests
      ```shell
      make test/integration
      ```
3. **test installation**
   ```shell
   make system=1 test
   ```
4. **configuration**  
   except for `system=1`, test behaviour is configured with environment variables.
   check the various files in [`src/test/`](https://github.com/FWDekker/mommy/tree/main/src/test) to find 'em all~

### üè¨ distribution
mommy is distributed in three ways:
* attached as **binary packages** to each github release,
* built on **external build servers**,
* and available as **source builds** ("ports", basically) on a few servers.

let's go into them in more detail~

<details>
<summary>üì¶ binary packages</summary>

the binary packages attached to the github release are built with the
[makefile](https://github.com/FWDekker/mommy/blob/main/GNUmakefile).
run `make list` to see a list of build targets;
you're looking for the ones starting with `dist/`~

to build the packages, you need at least gnu make, ruby, and fpm.
(actually, you don't need fpm for netbsd and openbsd.)
on debian-based systems, you already have gnu make, so you only need
```shell
sudo apt install ruby
sudo gem install fpm
```

after that, just run `make dist/deb` (or better: `mommy make dist/deb`), and a `.deb` package will be built in `dist/`.
run `make` or `make list` for a list of valid building targets.
a special target is `install`, which directly copies the files into the specified directories on your system.
these directories can be changed by setting `prefix` variables, as in `make prefix=/usr/ install`.
i recommend running `make --dry-run prefix=/usr/ install` first so you can verify that all directories are calculated
correctly.
check the `GNUmakefile` for more details~

all systems can build packages for themselves without additional dependencies.
if you want to compile for a different system, you may need additional dependencies.
for example, if you want to build packages for alpinelinux, archlinux, and rpm from a debian-like system, you will need
```shell
sudo apt install libarchive-tools rpm zstd
```
and then you can run
```shell
make apk pacman rpm
```
unfortunately, packages for macos, netbsd, and openbsd cannot be built on systems other than themselves~
</details>

<details>
<summary>üèóÔ∏è external build servers</summary>

a service builds mommy on-demand on each release, and makes the created packages available for all users.
currently, this happens only for fedora/epel at [copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/fwdekker/mommy/).
the relevant build files are hosted in
[mommy's `pkg/rpm/` directory](https://github.com/FWDekker/mommy/tree/main/pkg/rpm/)~
</details>

<details>
<summary>üå± source builds</summary>

some servers host instructions on how to build mommy, but don't do any work beyond that.
users connect to the server, get the latest instructions, and their system builds mommy for them locally~

* for **arch linux**, the [arch user repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/) hosts the
  [mommy package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mommy).
  a development mirror is hosted on github in [aur-mommy](https://github.com/FWDekker/aur-mommy)~
* for **homebrew**, mommy has the [homebrew-mommy](https://github.com/FWDekker/homebrew-mommy) repository on github,
  which is resolved automatically by the brew client based on the repository's name~
</details>

### üìØ release
`main` always contains the latest stable version.
every merge into `main` automatically build and releases a new version~

<details>
<summary>release checklists</summary>

* **before merging into `main`**
  * update `version`~
  * update `pkg/rpm/mommy.spec.rpkg`~
      * update release number~
      * update change log~
  * update `CHANGELOG.md`~
      * do not leave a placeholder section for `[Unreleased]`, because that will end up in the `.deb` changelogs~
      * remove empty subsections for the new release~
      * ensure no line breaks are used as whitespace;
        github release notes use them as actual line breaks~
  * update acknowledgements in `README.md`~
  * update promotional images in `.github/img/`~

* **after merging into `main`**
  * a new github release is created automatically~
  * [aur-mommy](https://github.com/FWDekker/aur-mommy/)
      * updated automatically when `mommy` updates
      * always [manually check deployment status](https://github.com/FWDekker/aur-mommy/actions?query=branch%3Amaster)~
  * [copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/fwdekker/mommy/)
      * updated automatically when `mommy` updates
      * always [manually check deployment status](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/fwdekker/mommy/builds/)~
  * [homebrew-mommy](https://github.com/FWDekker/homebrew-mommy)
      * updated automatically when `mommy` updates
      * always
        [manually check deployment status](https://github.com/FWDekker/homebrew-mommy/actions?query=branch%3Amain)~
</details>

### ü§† contribution guidelines
thank you for considering contributing to mommy!
below are some guidelines for contributions, but honestly, _any_ contribution is welcome, even if it's broken, because
surely we'll be able to figure something out together~

* add relevant documentation and tests~
